## Description

This application is a demonstration of event selection app where user can select events and see two views of selected and all Events.

### Running the code

Once you have unzipped or clone the repo and ready to start, you can run `npm install` to install dependencies. After that, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the application in development mode.

You can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

You can run the test cases by using

```bash
npm run test
```

Note: Please do not change the dependcy versions in `package.json` file as older version of react might not support some features and might create conflict with other dependecies.

### Feature Support

-   User will be able to select the events from all event list
-   Selected events will be shown in selected list and user can remove them from there.
-   Once removed it will come back to all event list
-   User won't be able to select events those have overlapping time ex: let's say user have selected event from 1:00PM to 2:00PM then user won't be able to select event from 1:30PM-2:30PM, Made some enhancements from initial requirement.
-   App is just responsive and separate mobile view is not there.

### Approach Taken [Most interesting Section ðŸ˜œ
